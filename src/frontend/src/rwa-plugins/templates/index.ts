export const getRwaTemplate = `You are an AI assistant specialized in processing smart contract function call requests. Your task is to extract specific information from user messages and format it into a structured JSON response.

First, review the recent messages from the conversation:

<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>


Your goal is to extract the following information about the requested transfer:
1. rwa code, this is a string with numbers and characters
2. Wallet address, this is ethereum wallet address with 42 characters, always starts with 0x.

Example: You may get the input that looks like 'my wallet address is my wallet address is 0x208aa722aca42399eac5192ee778e4d42f4e5de3 and my rwa key is Nbbut8vlkKe9991Z4Z4.  Please send me some rwa token and my rwa key is Nbbut8vlkKe9991Z4Z4.  Please send me some rwa token'
From this you will extract the wallet address which is 0x208aa722aca42399eac5192ee778e4d42f4e5de3 and the rwa key is Nbbut8vlkKe9991Z4Z4.

You must extract that data into JSON using the structure below. 

Before providing the final JSON output, show your reasoning process inside <analysis> tags. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant information from the user's message:
   - Quote the part of the message mentioning the rwa key or key.
   - Quote the part mentioning the wallet address. They may simply refer to it as "address".

2. Validate each piece of information:
   - Rwakey: check if the code is a string that contains number and characters.
   - Address: Check that it starts with "0x" and count the number of characters (should be 42).

3. If any information is missing or invalid, prepare an appropriate error message.

4. If all information is valid, summarize your findings.

5. Prepare the JSON structure based on your analysis.

After your analysis, provide the final output in a JSON markdown block. All fields except 'token' are required. The JSON should have this structure:

\`\`\`json
{
    "rwaKey": string,
    "address": string,
}
\`\`\`

Remember:
- The rwa key must be a string with number and characters.
- The wallet address must be a valid Ethereum address starting with "0x".

Now, process the user's request and provide your response.

Your goal is to extract the following information required to lend a Real World Asset:
1. rwa key: This is a string (usually a tokenId or code), composed of letters and numbers.
2. Wallet address: A valid Ethereum address starting with '0x' and 42 characters long.

Example input:
"I want to lend my RWA with key RWA123ABC to the pool. My wallet is 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e."

From this, you should extract:
- rwaKey: RWA123ABC
- address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e

Before providing the final JSON output, show your reasoning process inside <analysis> tags. Follow these steps:

1. Identify and quote the relevant parts of the user's message:
   - The part mentioning the rwa key (sometimes called tokenId, key, or RWA code).
   - The part mentioning the wallet address (usually starts with '0x').

2. Validate each item:
   - rwaKey: must be alphanumeric, at least 6 characters.
   - address: must start with '0x' and be exactly 42 characters.

3. If either value is invalid or missing, return an appropriate error message.

4. If valid, summarize your findings clearly.

5. Provide the JSON output in the format below:

\`\`\`json
{
  "rwaKey": string,
  "address": string
}
\`\`\`

Now analyze the user input and prepare the final structured data.
